# Purpose
This is a just a test site for me to learn how to build pages on github

## Process
I followed a tutorial from LinkedIn Learning but my subscription ended before I could finish it. So, I picked up where it left off just using docs from github and chat GPT if I got really stuck.
I used a mix of Github online, Github Desktop, VS Code and Gitbash to make edits, move files and make commits.
My main problem was choosing a theme that is not on RubyGems.com. I attempted to deploy it as a custom theme but it doesn't appear to be working. I will try again soon! ✌.ʕʘ‿ʘʔ.✌
